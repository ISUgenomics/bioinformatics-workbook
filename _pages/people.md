# Collaborators



### Andrew Severin

![Andrew](../assets/images/people/Andrew.png){: .align-left}
Andrew Severin is the manager of the Genome Informatics Facility. My group works at the interface between genetics and bioinformatics translating big data into informative data for interesting biological questions. I work with a wide variety of organisms from viruses, mycoplasmas and bacteria to soybean, maize, Arabidopsis, potato, nematode, pig, painted turtle, bees, wasps, zebrafish, abalone and yellowtailtuna. My broader research interests include understanding how a genome relates to a phenotype from a systems biology approach and comparative genomics.  The first step in this process has been the main focus for the last few years, which is the ability to create genomic resources for comparison (assembly, annotation, visualization) of many related organisms


### Sivanandan Chudalayandi

My expertise is in the field of molecular biology, genetics and computational biology, modern biological research routinely produce large scale data that aid in shedding light on a phenomena or point us in a newer research direction. As an Associate Scientist at the Genome Informatics Facility, I work as a bioinformatics liaison for the USDA community at large, I contribute to the community by way of tutorials, online discussions etc. I also collaborate with researchers in my capacity as computational biologist to perform data driven discovery.

### Rick E. Masonbrink
![Rick](../assets/images/people/Rick.jpg){: .align-left}
Currently, I am an associate scientist in the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University, working with a group of amazing people. Here, I work on a multitude of projects, including a continuation of my previous research. Some of these projects involve:  characterizing the genomes of endangered abalone species, assessing the cellular roles of small RNAs in nematodes, creating user-friendly bioinformatics tutorials, assessing transposition in irradiated maize, trans-splicing in nematodes, etc.  With the huge variation of collaborative projects that come into the Genome Informatics Facility, the constant influx of novel ideas creates an environment conducive to my development as a contributing member of the scientific community.


### Maryam Sayadi
![Maryam](../assets/images/people/Maryam.jpg){: .align-left}
I have recently joined the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University. I am mostly involved in generating and updating bioinformatics tutorials. My background is protein structure and function through molecular modeling simulations. My goal is a multidisciplinary approach involving protein interaction and structure and gene regulation.


### Arun S. Seetharam
![arun](../assets/images/people/Arun.jpg){: .align-left}
My main interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation sequencing including the first de novo assembly of a teosinte genome. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species.

### Jennifer Chang
![Jennifer](../assets/images/people/JenChangsm.png){: .align-left}
I am an Iowa State University graduate, with a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I have been programming (in one language or another) since 2006 and have an interest in data visualization and software development. My research focus has been on analyzing and merging networks, monitoring the evolution of influenza A viruses in swine, and writing cross-platform pipelines. In 2020, I joined the Genomics Informatics Facility in the hopes of developing interdisciplinary pipelines and tutorials to meet the needs of the widespread research community.


### Swapna Menon
