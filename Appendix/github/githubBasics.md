# Git Best Practices

* Commit often. Keep commits small and frequent. This also helps you have informative commit messages

--

* Make sure every commit "works". Never commit if it doesn't compile, runs with errors,
or requires files that only exist in your workspace. Since commits are snapshots, this should mean a working snapshot.

--

* Write commit messages that will be readable and useful to others and *future-you*. (This is really difficult.) Also, remember when your repository is public, anyone can see your commit messages.

--

* Use multiple branches. This is one of Git's most powerful features and enhances collaboration and reproducibility. You should
also decide on a [workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) (like [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)).

---

# Git Best Practices

* **Pull from the remote before you do anything in your repository.** This reduces potential merge conflicts. So before you make
changes to any files `git pull`, after you make a commit and before you push `git pull`.

--

* Don't commit unnecessary files. Often these are files that may be generated by your project
and can lead to merge conflicts.
You can keep these files in your working directory without being tracked using the `.gitignore` file
(or the `~/.gitignore_global` file in your home directory).

--

* Review your changes before committing.

--

* Use aliases. You can add specific aliases for Git commands in the `.gitconfig` file that lives in your home directory.

```
[alias]
hist = log --graph --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --date=short
last = log -1 HEAD
ci = commit
st = status
```

# Get Help

## No matter the problem (with Git or anything else in this class), someone else has encountered it already.

Google is an immensely powerful tool for troubleshooting computational problems

--

If you can articulate your problem in the form of a Google search query, you will likely find the answer online

--

These will primarily be on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), like my [recent search](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7155870/why-unicode-character-for-hearts-symbol-fails-with-html) for how to include
Unicode emoji characters in my Markdown presentation &#x1F60E; &#x1F4BB;


# GitHub Pages

### GitHub provides hosting for websites ([https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/))

* You can create a *free* website hosted on GitHub simply by creating a repository in your account called
`username.github.io`

  * For example, Wade Dismukes (a student in EEB) created his site in GitHub pages: [https://wadedismukes.github.io](https://wadedismukes.github.io/)



* Example website ([http://phyloworks.org](http://phyloworks.org)) is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/phyloworks/phyloworks.github.io), using a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS template.
If you [purchase](https://www.namecheap.com/) your own domain, it is simple to [redirect](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) your GitHub Pages site to the new domain.


* You can create a website for any GitHub project repository, simply by enabling GitHub Pages in your settings

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Remote Git repository hosting services

### There are several options for remote hosts

--

* You can set up your own server and host all of your repositories privately using [Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/) or [Gitosis](https://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-on-the-Server-Gitosis) (not recommended)

--

* You can use a web-based Git host

--

    * [GitHub](https://github.com/) <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png" alt="Drawing" width="35" />: free public repositories & paid private repositories, with repositories over 1 GB discouraged

--
    * [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) <img src="http://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/37/37104.png" alt="Drawing" width="25" />: unlimited free public & free private
    repositories, limited at 1-2 GB/repo (register with your *.edu* email to get unlimited
    collaborators on private repositories)
--
    * [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) <img src="https://maxcdn.icons8.com/Share/icon/color/Logos//gitlab1600.png" alt="Drawing" width="25" />: unlimited free public & free private repositories with no limits on collaborators, but limited at 10 GB/repo

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Despite the &#x2665;, Git does have some limitations

Most relevant to this course and our fields are:

* **_Repository size_**: If your repository gets very large, working within it can be a problem.
The network speed will be the main bottleneck. This is why the online Git hosts discourage repos
over 1-2 GB.

* **_File size_**: A single large file can be problematic, particularly if it is frequently being
modified. This can also lead to swollen repositories. GitHub will not allow any file over 100 MB.

* **_File type_**: Git works best with text files, you can have binary files in your
repository, but you lose some functionality of version control (like `diff`). Binary files
are also often very large. Thus, it is
recommended that you keep binary files to a minimum. (This means that it is not practical
to use Git to collaborate on MS Word documents.)

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Demo: Clone a Repository

You become familiar with the concepts by using Git. We will start by cloning [ipyrad](https://github.com/dereneaton/ipyrad).

ipyrad is a python program for interactive assembly and analysis of RAD-seq data sets

--

Start by going to [https://github.com/dereneaton/ipyrad](https://github.com/dereneaton/ipyrad) to get the URL.

--

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dereneaton/ipyrad.git
Cloning into 'ipyrad'...
remote: Counting objects: 11341, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (304/304), done.
remote: Total 11341 (delta 199), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 11037
Receiving objects: 100% (11341/11341), 70.75 MiB | 5.91 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (8275/8275), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Note that using the url `git@github...` instead of `https://github...` uses SSH
if you haven't configured your key yet, this may not work.

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_2x.png" alt="xkcd" width="250" /></div>

(image source [https://xkcd.com/1597](https://xkcd.com/1597/))

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository


**Always** `pull` from the repository before doing anything with the contents

```
$ git pull origin master
```

--

Check the `status` of your local files

```
$ git status
```

--

See the `log` of the snapshots and their commit messages

```
$ git log
```

--

Compare the `diff`erences a file you have modified and the last commit

```
$ git diff README.rst
```

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository

Replace a file you modified with the most recent commit using `checkout`

```
$ git checkout README.rst
```

--

Find out which `branch` you're on

```
$ git branch
```
--

Change to a different branch

```
$ git checkout h5step7
```

--

Pull to update from `h5step7`

```
$ git pull origin h5step7
```

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## What can you do with someone else's GitHub repository?

### If you do not have _push rights_

--

* You can only clone the repository and make changes locally

--

* You can **_fork_** their repository and develop it independently

--

* You can submit a **_pull request_** to their repository if you want to contribute to the original project

--

* You can contact the owner of the repository and ask them to include you as a
contributor and give you push rights (it is recommended that you discuss the nature of your collaboration with them first)

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Creating a Repository

Let's create a new Git repository and host it on GitHub using our accounts (for the demo,
I will create the repo in the [EEOB-BioData](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData) organization
so that everyone will have easy access to it).

<br>

--

But first, let's tell Git who you are

```
$ git config --global user.name "Ada Lovelace"
$ git config --global user.email "adal@analyticalengine.com"
```


---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for your new repository

--

Initialize a new Git repository

```
$ git init
```

--

After a file has been added or modified, you can stage the file

```
$ git add README.md
```

--

Commit the file to your local repository and write a message

```
$ git commit -m "initial commit (README.md)"
```


---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for your new repository

After you have made your commit, the repository is up-to-date locally. Next you need to connect
your local repo to the remote.

--

Add the remote

```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```

--

Push your snapshot to the remote

```
$ git push -u origin master
```
