  bio         : "His PhD was in Biophysics/NMR spectroscopy.  He did a Bioinformatics Postdoc in Soybean genetics and now runs the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University.  He is passionate about evolution and the science behind the genome. There is so much we don't know about how the elements in a genome interact to create the fine balance of gene expression, modification and 3D structure that create the dynamic range of phenotypes we observe.  As sequencing technology continues to improve and the cost continues to decrease, we will be able to ask more complex questions that increase our understanding via comparative and translational genomics.

  bio         : "I am fortunate to work as a research scientist in the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University, where I am surrounded by highly skilled bioinformaticians and constantly exposed to new ideas and approaches. This dynamic environment fosters my passion for science and my curiosity to keep learning and growing. With the support of the USDA, I have had the opportunity to create workshops and tutorials, and I also assist our faculty and industry collaborators through fee-for-service work. Over the years, I’ve been involved in a wide range of projects, developing and applying bioinformatics pipelines tailored to specific needs. I have also gained considerable experience in Hi-C scaffolding and genome annotation. I view this continuous exchange of ideas as key to my growth as both a researcher and a contributing member of the broader scientific community."
