# RNA-Seq data Analysis

RNA-seq experiments are performed with an aim to comprehend transcriptomic changes in organisms in response to a certain treatment. They are also designed to understand the cause and/or effect of a mutation by measuring the resulting gene expression changes. Thanks to some robust algorithms specifically designed to map short stretches of nucleotide sequences to a genome while being aware of the process of RNA splicing has led to many advances in RNAseq analysis. The overview of RNA-seq analysis is summarized in the following figure.
