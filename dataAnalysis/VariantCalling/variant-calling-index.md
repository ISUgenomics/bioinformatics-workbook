[Variant Discovery](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022645) tutorials:

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is an orthologous nucleotide position that is variable across the genomes under study. SNPs are the result of mutations that produce base-pair differences among chromosome sequences.
Their high abundance and genome-wide distribution make them a valuable source of genetic variation for studies of population demography, adaptation, and genome evolution (Brumfield et al. 2003, Morin et al. 2004).
Recently, SNPs have started to play an increasingly important role in phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies at much deeper evolutionary timescales ([read more](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022645))
