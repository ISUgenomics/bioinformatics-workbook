In [comparative genomics](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/comparative-genomics-13239404) one can:

* Compare the genome sequence of different species to study what distinguishes different life forms from each other at the molecular level.    
* Study evolutionary changes among organisms
* Identify conserved or common genes among Species
* Study the genes that are responsible for specific and unique characteristics for each organism
